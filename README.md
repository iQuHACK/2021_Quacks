# Quantum Mystery Flow

Quantum Mystery Flow is a quantum computing game written in Python that is intended to show newcomers how quantum circuits look and what their actions might result in when acting on a qubit. 

The premise is simple, once the game starts, a quantum circuit will be executed, and the final qubits on the Bloch Ssphere as well as the applied quantum gates will be shown to the user. The goal of the player is to determine the order in which the quantum gates were used. The qubits are always initialized as 0, and individual gates act only on the first qubit. 

Once you run the game, you will get: *mostrar fotos*

Future work
-Creating an option such that gates can also act on the first qubit
-Omitting gate combinations that might result in the qubit not being changed at all



* a clear title for your project,
* a short abstract,
* the motivation/goals for your project,
* a description of the work you did, and
* proposals for future work.

You can find a potential README template in [one of last year's projects](https://github.com/iQuHACK/QuhacMan).

Feel free to contact the staff with questions over our [event's slack](https://iquhack.slack.com), or via iquhack@mit.edu.

Good luck!
